			<question>
				<para>

				Why do Clutter applications run <emphasis>really</emphasis> slowly on Intel cards even though 
				direct rendering support is reported.

				</para>
			</question>			
			<answer>
				<para>

				There is a bug in some versions of the Intel drivers that causes the driver to 'stall' when 
				attempting to sync to vblank (as Clutter does by default). The fix is to either upgrade 
				your drivers or set 'CLUTTER_VBLANK=none' when running Clutter applications.
