 This is a redhat/perl bug.  Needs a workaround (LANG=C)
* Make patchmerge prompt for a comment and also allow named version
* DONE: (/var/tmp) Create the LPP dir with the correct permissions.

  * directory /var/lib/rpm is missing
   * FIX:
   mkdir /var/lib/rpm
   rpm --initdb
* DONE: Investigate hosting on ppc-linux
* DONE: Should be able to specified a toolchain location, without an rpm package
* DONE: config: TOOLCHAIN_PATH default from earlier sourced .lkc file
overides later .lkc (tqm, sandbox)
  * need dynamic sourcing, for now don't overlap options
* Should wget fall back to non-proxy if proxies are set
* DONE: yes: wget-1.9.1.spec, should --sysconfdir= be /etc not %{pfx}/etc 
* DONE: e500 cross tools won't compile vim

 host: /usr/bin/gcc
 targ: /opt/mtwk/usr/local/powerpc-linux/gcc-3.3.2-glibc-2.3.2/bin/$cross-gcc
 Fix: toolchain prefix is now includes the -, so: ${cross}gcc is used
* write a cross ldconfig, this is a large static executable
* Think about trimming out (from minimum distro)
    561883 ./sbin/ldconfig               yes

 * Added mkdistclean pseudo package.
* DONE: differentiate between sudo not found and too old
* DONE: permissions making directory /opt/freescale (install and rpm??)
 * use /var/tmp/freescale.  Not sure this is a great thing though
* DONE: write permissions in host's rpm build area
 * use host prefix's usr/src/rpm (e.g /var/tmp/freescale/usr/src/rpm)
* DONE: cannot use rpm < 4.04, need to bootstrap install this
* DONE: duplicate, see above: cross compilers install in host's rpm database ?
* DONE: move lpp to /var/tmp/freescale/pkgs?
* DONE: lkc-1.4 does not pick up defconfig

= Mon 28th Feb =
 * DONE: -p <package> should build even if the config disables the package

= Weds 2nd Mar =
 * prevent rpm from stripping .a files during the install section
 * DONE: LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5 to disable NPTL on RH9?
  * only needed for the host side rpm-fs package so far

= Thu 3rd Mar =
 * DONE: move spoof directory into the /var/tmp/freescale generic (shared) area
 * DONE: profiles don't work combined with --preconfig unless the configure script
 is run.  This will be needed for unattended builds to vary from min to max
 configurations
 * DONE, -p sets -f: -m scxxxx should imply -f

= Fri 4th March =
 * DONE: scdeploy should use the '%Files' clause from the original, this
 is needed to get the right permissions on files (e.g busybox)
 * if there is no mapping for a CONFIG_PKG_xxx, the selection is
 silently skipped, there should be at least a warning

= Mon 7th March =
 * DONE: ltib doesn't work well over NFS as rpmdb can't be used on an
 NFS directory due to locks over NFS.
  * Work around by changing dbpath in .ltibrc

 * DONE: /opt/Embedix/tools/bin/rpm conflicts with ltib if using toolchains 
 from there
  * explicit use of /var/tmp/freescale/usr/bin/rpm

= Mon 14th March =
 * DONE: if you swap profile, you should do a full clean first (and remove
 existing packages).  Else you get problems, for instance
 BASE_LIBS may have been installed for uclibc and then you call
 out a profile using a glibc toolchain.  The builds will fail as
 the wrong libraries are found in the rootfs.

 * DONE: rpm cannot delete stale BuildRoot if build by another user, the +t
 flag on the directory prevents this.
  * Override and put BuildRoot to /var/tmp/freescale/var/tmp/ ?
  * also BuildRoot is now withing the user's ltib area (tmp).

= Weds 30th March =
 * DONE: Need defconfig for imx21ads
 * DONE: Nice to have: detect platform switch and abort.
 * DONE: If an rcfile is specified, load_system_config() should not look for other files (~/.ltibrc).
 * DONE: Abort if a specified rcfile does not exist (ex: "--rcfile noSuchFile").
 * Check if 'conf' $cf->{conf} exists before using. 
 * DONE: Nice to have: option to print supported platforms, like: "ls config/platform/ | grep -v host | grep -v sandbox | grep -v CVS".
  * This is presented when you first run ltib, or after a distclean

= Thur 31st March =
 * DONE: add warning if cf->{gpp_url} is not set. (also catch others)
 * DONE: add --version|V option
 * DONE: clean out Metrowerks (e.g in etc/issue in skell) 
 * REJECT: (forgot what this is) --dry-run fails if 'conf' not in path
 * --dry-run downloads packages (which doesn't seem very "dry").  Would be nice to know what will be downloaded though.
 * DONE (I think): (bug) After fresh install, get confusing build error
   "spoofing is not set up at ./ltib line 1005."
  Problem is that the directory /var/tmp/freescale/usr/spoof does not exist.

= Mon 6th June = 
 * Improve/separate host side packages from target (needs thought).

 * add a test for zlib before building host packages (needed by rpm-fs)
 * DONE: remove texinfo build from host side, but do a dep check before build.
 * DONE: genext2fs dies: aclocal-1.8: command not found.  There is a race
 condition, both configure and aclocal.m4 get touched, sometimes this
 leads to configure being rebuilt which then fails (aclocal).

= Weds 22nd June =
 * psmisc fails on uclibc: fuser.c:257: undefined reference to `libintl_gettext'
 
= Fri 24th June =

 * DONE: add rsync-2.6.5
 * DONE: ltib now lists packages that fail to build
 * DONE: scbuild & scinstall  now implies -f
 * DONE: Add a list of supported host platforms to the Faq

= Thu 5th July =
 * rpm-fs temp dir: /var/tmp/freescale/var/tmp/ has wrong perms:
 drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root
 Strange.  There is nothing wrong with the rpm, something else
 looks to have clobbered this.  Also on bf3 
 /var/tmp/freescale/usr/src/rpm/BUILD got clobbered/missing
 Probably same issue.  Reported to happen on RH9.0 after a distclean
 The problem has been traced to tmpwatch being run by cron.
 * make sure filenames are limited to 64 chars as reports of truncation
 on iso image (8548 spe toolchain)
 * DONE: fixup mtd-utils-flash_eraseall.patch, remove 'static' from
 static int target_endian (at least).  FC4 host compiler strictness.

= Thurs 14th July =
 * DONE (not a bug) on installation, say it's going to make the ltib directory
 * DONE: -m distclean leaves some artifacts (rootfs).  Added a distclean
 pseudo package which mops up this stuff.

= Fri 15th July =
 * DONE: add a means to search and jump to the searched item
 * FC-2 dies when building host pkgs due problems with the autoconf
 we installed. 

= Wed 20th July =

 patch looks buggy (new patch from Chris)
 * DONE: fix md5sum generation/checking

= Weds 31st Aug =
 * DONE: should not be able to do --preconfig with the -p <package> option.
 * ./ltib --preconfig config/platform/mpc8548cds/tor-hsv_def.config --configure --batch does set overriden defaults such as CONFIG_PKG_KERNEL_PRECONFIG
 This has been traced to the apparently correct behaviour of lkc.  If
 a string item does not have a prompt, then it's saved valued in a .config
 can be overriden by a 'calculated' value when you re-run mconf.  The
 solution seems to be to add a prompt to any string values that need
 to be kept from the --preconfig file.

= Mon 5th Sept =
 * DONE: skell: rcS restarts (f_portmap, settime), /etc/passwd, /etc/fstabroofs,

 is a relative path (e.g config/platform/<bsp>/<preconfig>

= Mon 19th Sept =
 * ppp_upload.cgi: consider clearing textbox after upload.  Also move

 been fixed.

= Tues 25th Oct =
 * Add a flag to drop into the spoofing environment

= Mon 28th Nov =
 * ftpd from inetutils is reduntant (should use vsftpd) remove.

= Tue 29th Nov =
 * build of skell must trigger build of sysconfig

= Fri 2nd Dec =
 * ./ltib -p <pkg> should warn if package is not mapped in the BSP
 * ./ltip -p <pkg> should do package stem matching so ./ltib -p u-boot
 will find the right one for your configured BSP.  At the same time
 change '-s' to me -s <spec> to allow unmapped packages to be built
 for a BSP.

 * upgrade gdb -> 6.3 and merge in any patches from older version
 * put the bootloader at the toplevel like the kernel

 * Change patchmerge to choose the name and also request a comment

= Tues 28th Feb =
 * Overhall the kernel.spec files and main.lkc so that we pass the
 correct kernel target in from SYSCFG_KTARG (e.g uImage, or zImage).
 These should be conditioned in the platforms main.lkc so that if
 you select u-boot, you get something different from redboot etc.
 Also, we need to take care of which kernel we copy dependant on 
 that selection.

 * figure out what rpm/BUILD/pax_global_header is

= Thu 6th July =
 * DONE: Investigate yacc (byacc) dependency on Suse9.3 reported by Jafar

= Thur 19th Oct =
 * A toolchain change in cvs updated defconfig did not cause a full rebuild?

= Mon 23rd Oct =
 * Change of toolchain should force a clean of the rootfs as well as
 a full rebuild.  If you don't, unremoved interface libraries get linked
 and can cause problems (e.g uClibc to glibc TC causes depend on libc.so.1)

 * imx31:184: df command can't find the root device on a jffs2 rootfs deployment
 Another solution is to patch /etc/udev/rules.s/10-mx31.rules
on the target as follows:
-KERNEL=="mtdblock*",   NAME="mtdblock/%n"
+KERNEL=="mtdblock*",    NAME="mtdblock/%n",     SYMLINK+="mtdblock%n"

 * imx31:183@ LTIB "device nodes" package should be udev aware

= Weds 25th Oct =
 * DONE: real devfsd won't start with busybox style devfs.conf file (from skell)
 added an install dependency in ltib for this.
 * DONE: The real 'top' (psmisc) does not show proper output (but moves cursor)
 upgraded package to 3.2.7

= Tue 28th Nov =
 * add rpm database to target?
