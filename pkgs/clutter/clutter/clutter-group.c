 * @short_description: Actor class containing multiple children.
 * actors.
 *
 * A #ClutterGroup is an Actor which contains multiple child actors positioned
 * relative to the #ClutterGroup position. Other operations such as scaling,
 * rotating and clipping of the group will apply to the child actors.
 *
 * A #ClutterGroup's size is defined by the size and position of its children.
 * Resize requests via the #ClutterActor API will be ignored.
