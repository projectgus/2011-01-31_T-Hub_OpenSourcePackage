+---------- snip -------
+This patch comes from:
+http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2001-03/msg00699.html
+
+and fixes makes sure the syslimits.h file is installed in
+the GCC include directory.
+STMP_FIXINC is set to empty by build-make.  The prefix /cygwin is
+different from the prefix where the GNU/Linux hosted arm-elf-gcc is
+installed, so later cygwin hosted arm-elf-gcc does not find
+syslimits.h.
+
+This problem was encountered during a Canadian Cross build for a
+i686-pc-cygwin hosted cross toolchain.
