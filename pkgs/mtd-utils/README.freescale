This is a sub-set taken from the mtd project. Specifically:
ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/people/dwmw2/mtd/cvs/mtd-snapshot-20060302.tar.bz2

This is used just to build the utilities for the host side so we
can make jff2 filesystems etc.  All the unused directories have been
removed.

Changes: 
  * util/Makefile  : to cleanly install when rpm built
