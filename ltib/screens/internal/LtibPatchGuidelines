---+ Guidelines for changes to Open Source code (patches)

---++ General

   * Never remove/change an existing copyright.

   * You cannot use a patch to change the terms of a license.  You must
   go back to the original file and make the change there.  This can
   only be done if you have the legal right/permission to make this 
   change.  The reason for this is that people can cherry pick patches.
   If they choose not to take a patch that is intended to fix up a 
   license, then a source tree with an inappropriate license may be
   propagated.

   * Never remove a maintainer/author citation/credit.

   * You may only change your own email addresses in a patch

   * Any change of more than a couple of lines requires you to add a
   copyright notice entry for Freescale.  You should also add a
   changelog entry that cites the person making the change, email addr,
   date and purpose  of the change.

   * You should never include proprietary code in open source patches/files.

   * You should never put in license notices into patches/files that are
   incompatible with the license of the code base it is patching.


   * Copyright and Licenses are entirely different things.  You should
   understand the difference.

   * If you copy a file and use it as the basis for your new file, you
   should retain all the existing copyright notices and update notices.
   You should clearly say that this file is based on xxxx and say where
   it came from.  You should also state in the description what the
   new purpose is.

   * New files should include Freescale's copyright notice, along with
   a citation for author, date that include a description of what the file
   does.  An empty changelog section should be placed in the file.  The brief
   form of the GPL license (example below) should be included).
