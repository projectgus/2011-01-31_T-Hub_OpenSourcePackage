---+ Introduction

The LTIB (Linux Target Image Builder) project is a simple tool that can be used to develop and deploy BSPs (Board Support Packages) for various target platforms. Using this tool a user will be able to develop a GNU/Linux image for their target platform. For more information, see the [[/autodocs/LtibFaq.html][LtibFaq]]

---+ Quick install

If you just want to try out LTIB as an end user and have a Linux host
machine, download the following simple installer [[netinstall][netinstall]] and run as
a non-root account:
<verbatim>
$ perl netinstall
</verbatim>

If you need to know more, please read on.

---++ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) 

The FAQ is probably the first place you should go to find out more about
LTIB.  It has information on getting it, installing it and using it.  [[/autodocs/LtibFaq.html][click here]] 

---++ Platforms and their sources/patch availability

This page show which platforms (BSPs) are available in LTIB.  Each one of
these has a clickable link that shows the sources and patches that make
up each package configure in the platform's default configuration.  By
looking at these pages you can quickly see if they are payload complete.  [[/autodocs/bsp_ext_ava.html][click here]] 

---++ GPP (Global Package Pool) files  

The GPP is the public storage location for all the sources/patches referenced
by LTIB.   This link gives a directory listing off all files in the GPP [[/gpp][click here]]

---++ GPP (Global Package Pool) file information

For those files which have been uploaded through this site to the GPP
this page will list the meta-information that was uploaded with the file.  [[/gpp_info][click here]]

*Note:* much of the content was migrated from another source, very few
files have info files associate at the moment.

---++ Upload a file to the GPP

If you are a developer and you want to participate in LTIB, as a project
member you'll be able to upload files to the GPP.  The link to do this is [[/cgi-bin/gpp_upload.cgi][click here]]
