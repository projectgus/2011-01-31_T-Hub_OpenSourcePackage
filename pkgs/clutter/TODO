Definetly:

 * More ClutterUnits support, convert actor API to units.
 * Fragment shader support infrastructure
 * XML/JSON type 'layout' files - include actors + behaviours + timeline etc.
 - App developers manual.
 * Events for Actors
   * Add 'sensitive' property, false by default. Only pick sensitive actors
   * Very simple focus model - actors have a focus flag and if set emit
     key events.
   * Motion events need to be explicitly enabled. 
 - Mipmaps for pango renderer to improving text scaling quality
 * ClutterScore
   * Class for chaining timelines together

Nice/Maybe:

 - Lookat type functionality.
 - Improve cogl massively to be be processing like.
 - Gradient support ?
 - Rectangle like props to all actors
 - Glitz integration
 * Some kind of focus model.
 * Apple/Win native backends.
 * ClutterBehaviourDepth (trivial)
 - ClutterTextureAnimation (trivial)
 - Glitz backend over GLX (would cover above)

(Also see bugzilla.o-hand.com bug with 0.6 milestones for more
 detail/status on the above)
