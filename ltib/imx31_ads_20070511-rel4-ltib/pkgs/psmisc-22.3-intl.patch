When building with uClibc toolchains where libintl_gettext comes
from the gettext package (libintl) rather than built into the 
clibrary, this change is needed.  The symptom was:

/home/seh/ltib_bsps/875/rpm/BUILD/psmisc-22.3/src/fuser.c:85: undefined reference to `libintl_gettext'

This patch was originated by Stuart Hughes.
