  <title>Overview</title>

  <partintro>

    <para>Clutter is a GObject based library for creating fast, visually
    rich, graphical user interfaces.</para>

    <para>Clutter works by manipulating a scene-graph of 2D surfaces, or
    'actors', inside a 3D space.</para>

    <para>#ClutterActor is the base class for such surfaces. All
    #ClutterActor<!-- -->s can be positioned, scaled and rotated in 3D space.
    In addition, other properties can be set, such as 2D clipping, children and
    opacity. Tranforms applied to a parent actor also apply to any children.
    Actors are also able to receive events.</para>

    <para>Subclasses of #ClutterActor include #ClutterStage, #ClutterTexture,
    #ClutterLabel, #ClutterRectangle, #ClutterEntry and
    #ClutterGroup. #ClutterActor<!-- -->s are added to a parent, transformed
    and then made visible.</para>

    <para>#ClutterStage is the top level #ClutterActor - it's the
    representation of a window, or framebuffer. It is created automatically
    when Clutter is initialised. #ClutterStage is a #ClutterGroup, a class
    implementing the #ClutterCointainer interface.</para>

    <para>#ClutterTimeline<!-- -->s provide the basis for Clutter's animation
    utilities. Multiple timelines can be synchronised using #ClutterScore,
    and #ClutterBehaviour and #ClutterEffect allow for the creation of
    animation effects such as transitions.</para>

    <para>Clutter further contains a number of utilities, including;
    #ClutterScript - for loading 'UI definition' files formatted in
    <ulink type="http" url="http://json.org">JSON</ulink>, #ClutterShader - a
    class for applying GPU shaders to actors, #ClutterModel - a utility class
    for MVC list type implementations, and fixed point math utilities.</para>
